# CrabChampionSaveManager
a save manager for Crab Champions, made in Python 

made this for a group of friends to manage saves easier 
feel free to use it yourself, it is text-based, just run the file

Main Credits:<br>
Pyinstaller - used to make .exe versions of the script so that it can be run without having to get python or uesave<br>
uesave - https://github.com/trumank/uesave-rs, all credit for this goes to trumank, this is a program made in rust but compiled to .exe , allows translating Unreal Engine .sav files to json and back again<br>
ChatGPT - used for some comments and code snippets , i am still learning about python after all<br>

install:<br>
  if you have crab champions installed at the default location then you don't need to do anything<br>
  if crab champions is installed in a different location then you need to put the script in the save game location<br>
  you would put it at %LOCALAPPDATA%\CrabChampions\Saved for the default location , use that to try to determine what the location is for you if it is a custom location <br>

use:<br>
  just start the program and it should open a cmd window<br>
  this program is cmd line based so just type in the number that links to the option you want and then press enter<br>
  both the .py and .exe versions work very similar <br>


FAQ:<br>
Q: Can I help write and commit code?<br>

A: This is my first biggish project and as such I would rather write it myself, but that doesn't mean I won't "borrow" any code in an issue or pull request, feature requests, suggestions, and ideas are welcome<br>
