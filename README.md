# CrabChampionSaveManager

a save manager for Crab Champions, made in Python 

currently going through refactor to make it easy to maintain and make it work with latest version of Crab Champions

working on the rewrite with a friend and we decided to use a new repo for the rewrite, i did not do the best job on this one and we think it's best to start fresh, this repo will not be deleted but rather archived and have a link to the new repo when it's public
