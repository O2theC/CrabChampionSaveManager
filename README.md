# CCSM

The best save manager for Crab Champions <br>
allows for:
  - The transfer of saved runs without losing global data
  - The creation of presets which can be used to create new runs with a twist
  - Save editing using our custom TUI, or through basic text editing

## Main Credits:
UESave - By Trumank - Allows for the conversion of Unreal Engine save files to and from JSON format - https://github.com/trumank/uesave-rs

## Install:  
Create a new directory anywhere, and put the desired version of the program in it.
If you are using the .exe version, simply double click the file, the .py version is required to be run via the terminal (Windows 10: Powershell, Windows 11: Terminal)
### Windows: 
[Executable download (.exe)](https://github.com/O2theC/CrabChampionSaveManager/releases/latest/download/CrabChampionSaveManager.exe) - Generally simpler as you don't have to deal with a seperate UESave binary<br>
[Python script download (.py)](https://github.com/O2theC/CrabChampionSaveManager/releases/latest/download/CrabChampionSaveManager.exe) - Program in its purest form. Requires the UESave binary in the same directory
### Linux
[Python script download (.py)](https://github.com/O2theC/CrabChampionSaveManager/releases/latest/download/CrabChampionSaveManager.py) - On linux it will download a version of UESave for linux, but it is likely that it isn't compatible with your distro, and, as such, you should compile it yourself
## Wiki
i am making a wiki for the program and parts of the game as it relates to CCSM

## Use:<br>
  just start the program and it should open a cmd window<br>



# FAQ:<br>
Q: Can I write code rather than creating an issue waiting?<br>

A: 100%! If you tested it and it works, feel free to submit a pull request! I'll test it and give the verdict, but please create an issue as well<br>
and link the pull request to it.
