# FAQ:<br>
Q: Can I help write and commit code?<br>

A: This is my first biggish project and as such I would rather write it myself, but that doesn't mean I won't "borrow" any code in an issue or pull request, feature requests, suggestions, and ideas are welcome  

Q: I have questions about the program, how can i contact you?

A: either submit an issue with your question or send me a msg to my discord( o2c )

Q: i have a problem with the program

A: check the wiki, it may or may not have info about common issues, other wise make an issue or contact me on discord at o2c

Q: my antivirus flags this as malware / virus

A: this is not malware or a virus , check it on virustotal (it has been known to get hit by a few vendors but last i checked, it was at max 4 out of 70 vendors ), plus if you want then look through the source code / use the source code
