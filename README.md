# CrabChampionSaveManager
a save manager for Crab Champions, made in Python 

made this for a group of friends to manage saves easier 
feel free to use it yourself, it is text-based, just run the file

Main Credits:
Pyinstaller - used to make .exe versions of the script so that it can be run without having to get python or uesave
uesave - https://github.com/trumank/uesave-rs, all credit for this goes to trumank, this is a program made in rust but compiled to .exe , allows translating Unreal Engine .sav files to json and back again
ChatGPT - used for some comments and code snippets , i am still learning about python after all

install:

  if you have crab champions installed at the default location then you don't need to do anything
  if crab champions is installed in a different location then you need to put the script in the save game location
  you would put it at %APPDATA%\..\\Local\CrabChampions\Saved for the default location , use that to try to determine what the location is for you if it is a custom location 

use:

  just start the program and it should open a cmd window
  this program is cmd line based so just type in the number that links to the option you want and then press enter
  both the .py and .exe versions work very similar
